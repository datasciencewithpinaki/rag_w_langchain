Toys still have clearly gendered associations, such as dolls for girls and different colors like pink for girls and blue for boys being used to target children. The social messages about gender in toy advertising also remain relatively unchanged. \n",

It mentions that a visit to a toy store may give the impression that not much has changed, and it discusses the persistence of gendered marketing in the toy industry, as well as some recent shifts towards gender-neutral toys in certain places. However, detailed changes in toy stores are not described in the given text. \n",

Despite the study's findings on subtle changes in marketing, the general observation suggests that the toy industry's approach remains much the same as it has been in past decades. \n",
