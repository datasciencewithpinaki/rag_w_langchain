What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?,"Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships.",l0
How do you handle missing data in a dataset?,"Common methods include removing rows/columns with missing values, imputing missing values using mean/median/mode, or using algorithms that support missing values.",l0
Can you explain the concept of overfitting and how to prevent it?,"Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of the signal. It can be prevented using techniques like cross-validation, pruning, regularization, or using simpler models.",l1
"What is a confusion matrix, and why is it useful?","A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It helps in understanding the model's accuracy and types of errors.",l0
Describe the process of feature engineering.,"Feature engineering involves creating new features from raw data to improve model performance. This includes transforming, combining, and scaling features, as well as encoding categorical variables.",l0
"What is cross-validation, and why is it important?",Cross-validation is a technique to assess how well a model generalizes to an independent dataset. It involves splitting data into training and validation sets multiple times. It helps in avoiding overfitting and provides a more accurate estimate of model performance.,l0
How do you choose the right evaluation metric for your model?,"The choice of evaluation metric depends on the problem and business objectives. For example, accuracy might be suitable for balanced datasets, while precision, recall, or F1-score are better for imbalanced datasets.

What are the differences between correlation and causation?,"Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, indicating whether they move together. Causation implies one variable directly affects another. Correlation does not imply causation.",l1
How do you ensure your analysis is reproducible?,"Ensure reproducibility by documenting code and steps, using version control, sharing datasets and scripts, and setting a consistent environment (e.g., using virtual environments or Docker).",l1
Can you explain the bias-variance tradeoff?,"The bias-variance tradeoff is the balance between a model's simplicity and its ability to generalize. High bias means underfitting, while high variance means overfitting. The goal is to find a model with low bias and variance to achieve good generalization.",l1
